# kaiju [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drivernation/kaiju.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drivernation/kaiju)
Kaiju is a web application framework for the Go programming language. It brings together the standard Go libraries and a number of third party libraries in a sane way, providing developers with a single, easy-to-use web app framework.

Kaiju makes use of the following third party libraries:
* [Gorrilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) for muxing HTTP(S) requests.
* [Seelog](https://github.com/cihub/seelog) for logging all the things.
* And more to come!

Aside from the aforementioned third party libraries, Kaiju provides some of its own tooling, such as a service framework for convenient management of long running processes.
